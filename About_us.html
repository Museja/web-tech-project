        <h2>Meet the founder</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Monique Miller, the founder of PetFam Adoption Agency. I started this organization with a simple mission in mind: to provide a safe and loving haven for abandoned pets in need. My passion for animals has always been a driving force in my life, and I’m dedicated to making a difference in the lives of these furry companions. At PetFam, we believe that every pet deserves a second chance at happiness, and we’re committed to helping them find loving families who will cherish them forever. Join us on this journey to create a brighter future for animals in need – together, we can make a real difference!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>At PetFam Adoption Agency, we kicked off our journey in February 2021, fueled by a heartfelt commitment to shelter and care for abandoned pets in need. Our mission? To create a safe and loving haven for animals who have nowhere else to turn, while also helping them find families ready to welcome them with open arms. We recognized a growing demand for a reliable organization focused on rescuing and rehoming animals, which is why we founded PetFam – to ensure that no pet is left behind and every one of them gets a second chance at a joyful life.
            <h2>Our mission</h2>
            <p>  We’re more than just an adoption agency; we’re a family. We offer more than just shelter – we provide comprehensive care, emotional support, and guidance every step of the way during the adoption process. From rescue to rehoming, we prioritize the well-being of each animal, ensuring they are matched with families who are ready to meet their needs. Our work is grounded in compassion, and our ultimate goal is to make sure that every pet in our care finds a forever home filled with love and security.</p>
